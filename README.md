# TipRepo
Project 1-Tip Calculator
This tip calculator app created as the first project assigned for the computer programming intensive Justice Through Code at Columbia University. 

# Description
This program runs properly in python from the command line, and does not require  any sofftware  or  external libraries. It takes user input to calculate the amount each person owes on a bill, including tax and tip.

# From the terminal
Clone this repo
CD into the repo folder
Run python3 tip_calculator.py

# Clone the Tip Calculator Repository
Copy the code below and paste into your command line:
https://github.com/jlotto8/TipCalculator.git 

# Run the Tip Calculator
After it has been cloned, open a folder for the repository, and run the program by entering:
python3 tip_calculator.py

# Usage
The tip calculator runs with python3
Please note that 'python3' is used for the latest version of python that you have installed. Try 'python' or 'py' as alternatives. 

# How it Works/User Prompts
Once the program is running, the following questions/prompts will appear.
Asks for user input for the amount of the bill
Asks for user input for how many people in the group
Asks for user input for what percent tip the would like to leave, with options

These questions will only accept numbers. If invalid data is used as input, an error message will be displayed with instructions of how to enter valid data. 

The app will perform the following calculations:
Calculates the tip amount
Calculates the sales tax amount
Calculates the bill, tip, and sales tax total
Splits the total by thee amount of people in the group

# Sample Input and Output 

Inputs
Food costs $15
1 person paying
20% tip
Expected output:

Total bill: $19.50


Inputs
Food costs $25000000
3 people paying
31% tip
Expected output:

Total bill: $35,250,000.00
Each person should pay $11,750,000.00


# Repeat tip calculation:
    After calculating the total bill, and how much each person owes, the user will be asked if they would like to add any additinal tip

# Repeat the program:
    After the repeat tip calculation, the user will be asked if it wants to start again. If so, the program will run again from the beginning
